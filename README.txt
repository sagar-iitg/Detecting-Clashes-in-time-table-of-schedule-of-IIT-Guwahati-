FOR QUESTION 2


i have done both the codes in same program 
1.exam time table clash 
2.the courses which are included in class time table but not in exam time table.

Input is of the format:
##BioTechnology
BT201,Biochemical Process Calculations,Prof. Debasish Das+Dr. Senthilkumar Sivaprakasam,22 Sep 2019 (09.00 to 11.00),29 Nov 2019 ( 09:00 to 12:00 ),

which specifies the course and it's corresponding mid-sem and end-sem dates.

For each line in the input file, if the mid-sem or end-sem dates for courses in a program are same(for each semester), I am showing the clash.
